# Fern Herm

Fern Herm is a mobile-focused web service connecting users to the perfect pet and/or plant sitter. 

## Description

The name of our app *Fern Herm* is a play on words from the iconic 1980's Film **E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial** and the character's  "Phone Home" line. Our app allows users to find potential sitters for their pet or plant or, conversely, allows potential sitters to find a job looking after someone is while they are away from home. Users can post job listings, setup a profile for themselves, their pets, and their plants, view others' profiles, communicate with each other using our live chat feature, find interesting local events, use our built-in map and calendar features to keep organized, and even look up information regarding plant or animal species/breeds with which they might be unfamiliar.
